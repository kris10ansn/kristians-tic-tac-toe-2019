# 2019 - Tic Tac Toe Online

School project I made in 10th grade. I think my goal at the time was to use as few dependencies as possible, the only one being firebase to avoid having to write a backend.

The game allows you to play against either a computer (min-max algorithm, unbeatable), a local opponent or a remote online player.

While some things are overengineered and others underengineered, I am pretty proud of making this at 15 years old.
